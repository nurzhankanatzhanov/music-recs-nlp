## CSE 543T - Nonlinear Optimization | Final Project

### README:

If you are trying to run a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb file), there are a lot of guidelines online of how to do it, but some of the best we found are [here](https://www.codecademy.com/article/how-to-use-jupyter-notebooks).

To run a piece of code, click on the cell to select it, then press SHIFT+ENTER. Alternatively, you could press on "Cell" and then "Run All" to run all of the code cells at once (top of the page).

Note: 1st experiment is in "final-first-experiment.ipynb", 2nd experiment is in "FinalProjExp2.ipynb".

There are already some instructions in the respective Jupyter Notebooks, but I will include them here as well:

1. Link to download [gensim](https://pypi.org/project/gensim/) library
2. Link how to download [nltk.corpus](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22211525/how-do-i-download-nltk-data) for stopwords. We noted in the notebook where you would have to uncomment a piece of code to download the necessary stopwords.
3. We have a zip of all the 71 albums we use for our dataset, and you will need to change the path to it in the notebooks. The path provided is local. Please update the path in the notebook to your personal local machine path when trying to run the .ipynb file (after downloading and unzipping the zip file).

For the experiment 2, it is best to run the notebook in Google Colab. Simply add the included text file to your google drive and change the path name to your own google drive to run the notebook successfully.
